Responses are filtered for a given FirmStep contact's Unique Customer Reference Number (UCRN).\nSome fields may have multiple values and are defined with a format of CSV. In these fields each of the values is concatenated together with a comma between them e.g. An account which has 3 addresses where the house numbers of each address have been changed to 23, 9 and 211 respectively, will be returned with the field address_house_to having value 23,9,211. If there isn't a value for one of 3 inputs then that section of the string is left blank. Using the example where the new value for the houses number at each address is 23 for the first address, the second address has not been updated and the last addresses new  house number is 211 the value for the field 23,9,211 will be 23,'',211.
